# MTT Notes
**About:** An Open Source Note Taking And To Do App Built On Vanilla JavaScript. There are two versions available currently - v1,v2.    
**Last Updated On:** 29 April 2022 (IST)   
**Created On:** 4 August 2021 (IST)   
**License:** MIT License   
**Major Version Differences:**   
1. v1 Is Less Secure than v2 as there is no login/password entry for seeing the notes in the browser itself, making anyone who has access to your browser access to the notes you wrote. v2 solves this by implementing a encryption while storing in the browser.    
2. v1 had a todo list which was removed in v2 as it didnt serve much purpose.   
3. v2 supports markdown and LATEX and has a much more modern UI.
